## Season 9 – Grants Council

The Grants Council funds projects that **grow Superchain adoption by increasing DEX liquidity in priority pairs** and the **fees generated from trading those pairs**.

### Our Objective
Projects must target **one of the following metrics**:

#### DEX TVL in Priority Pairs (Liquidity)
- **Why it matters:** Deep liquidity in priority pairs reduces slippage, improves execution, and unlocks more onchain activity across the Superchain.
- **Formula:** ΔPairTVL = AvgPairTVL_end − AvgPairTVL_start

#### DEX Fees in Priority Pairs
- **Why it matters:** Fees measure real trading demand and willingness to pay to use Superchain venues for swaps.
- **Formula:** ΔPairFees = PairFees_end − PairFees_start

Examples of eligible projects:
- Incentive programs that **increase and retain** liquidity in priority pairs
- Vaults, strategies, or automation that **improve depth** for priority pairs (example: concentrated liquidity management)
- Routing, aggregation, or UX that **increases volume and fees** in priority-pair pools
- Integrations that **move existing liquidity** into eligible priority pools and keep it there
- Tooling that tracks, monitors, or improves **priority-pair TVL and fee performance**
